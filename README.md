# Dev Environments Extension

Allows you to quickly jump from a Github repo, branch or PR to a local development environment with the tools you need to test and run your workload -- using [Dev Environments](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/dev-environments/) -- by adding a button to Github and Bitbucket (more to come).

<!-- todo: add marketplace links here-->

Supports Firefox, Chrome and Edge.
